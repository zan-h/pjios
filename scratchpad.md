# PhoneJail - iOS App Blocking System with LLM Jailkeeper

## Background and Motivation
The goal is to create an iOS app that helps users manage their screen time and app usage through an engaging LLM-based "jailkeeper" system. Users must convince an AI jailkeeper to grant them access to blocked apps, making the process of app access more mindful and intentional. Users will have full control over which apps they want to block and manage.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
1. iOS ScreenTime API Integration
   - Need to understand and implement ScreenTime API for app blocking
   - Must handle permissions and user authorization
   - Need to ensure compliance with Apple's guidelines
   - Must implement app discovery and selection mechanism
   - Consider fallback mechanisms if ScreenTime API is not available
   - Handle edge cases like system updates affecting ScreenTime functionality

2. LLM Integration
   - Secure API integration with an LLM service
   - Managing different jailkeeper personalities
   - Handling conversation state and context
   - Ensuring appropriate and safe responses
   - Implement rate limiting and cost management
   - Handle offline scenarios and API failures
   - Consider local LLM options for privacy

3. User Experience
   - Creating an engaging interface for jailkeeper interactions
   - Managing app blocking/unblocking states
   - Providing clear feedback on blocked apps and access status
   - Intuitive app selection interface
   - App categorization and filtering
   - Implement onboarding flow for first-time users
   - Add accessibility features
   - Consider dark/light mode support

4. Security and Privacy
   - Secure storage of user preferences and settings
   - Privacy considerations for LLM interactions
   - Data protection for user conversations
   - Secure storage of blocked app list
   - Implement data backup and restore functionality
   - Consider end-to-end encryption for sensitive data
   - Handle app uninstallation scenarios

5. Performance and Reliability
   - Optimize battery usage
   - Handle background/foreground transitions
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Add crash reporting and analytics
   - Consider memory management for long-running sessions
   - Implement proper state management

Would you like me to proceed with implementing the ScreenTime service?

## Lessons
- Xcode is required for iOS development and must be installed before proceeding
- The Xcode Command Line Tools are separate from the full Xcode installation
- Always verify project structure before making changes
- Use MVVM architecture for better code organization and testability
- Set up .gitignore before first commit to avoid committing unnecessary files
- Push to remote repository early to ensure proper tracking
- Use Swift's type system to enforce business rules (e.g., AppBlock states)
- Use Combine for reactive programming and state management
- Implement proper error handling and loading states

## Next Steps
1. Install Xcode from the Mac App Store
2. Install Xcode Command Line Tools
3. Begin with project initialization and basic structure
4. Research ScreenTime API documentation and requirements
5. Research LLM integration options and requirements
6. Design app selection interface
7. Implement app discovery mechanism
