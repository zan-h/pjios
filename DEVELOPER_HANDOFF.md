# PhoneJail OS - Developer Handoff Guide

## üì± **App Overview**

PhoneJail OS is an innovative iOS app that helps users manage their screen time through a conversational AI "jailkeeper" system. Instead of traditional app blocking, users must convince an AI jailkeeper through natural conversation to gain access to their blocked apps and settings.

### **Core Concept**
- Users create "schemas" (blocking rules) that restrict access to selected apps/websites
- When strict mode is enabled, both the Schemas tab and Settings tab become locked
- To modify schemas or settings, users must convince an AI jailkeeper through conversation
- The jailkeeper has different personalities (Strict/Balanced/Lenient) and evaluates requests intelligently
- Temporary access is granted for 5-15 minutes based on the jailkeeper's personality

## üèóÔ∏è **Current Architecture**

### **Tech Stack**
- **Platform**: iOS 15.0+, SwiftUI
- **Backend**: Local-first with UserDefaults persistence
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4 via API
- **App Blocking**: iOS Family Controls framework (Screen Time API)
- **Architecture**: MVVM with Services layer

### **Key Components**

#### **Services Layer**
- `ScreenTimeService.swift` - Handles iOS Family Controls integration for app blocking
- `LLMService.swift` - Manages OpenAI API communication for jailkeeper conversations
- `AccessControlService.swift` - Controls when schemas/settings tabs are locked
- `SettingsService.swift` - Manages global app settings (strict mode, personalities, etc.)

#### **Models**
- `Schema.swift` - Core data model for blocking rules with conditions (schedule, usage limits)
- `Jailkeeper.swift` - AI personality and conversation management
- `AppBlock.swift` - Individual app blocking configuration

#### **Views**
- `ContentView.swift` - Main tab controller with conditional access control
- `SchemasView.swift` - Schema management interface (939 lines - very comprehensive)
- `JailkeeperChatView.swift` - Conversational AI interface
- `LockedSchemasView.swift` - Shown when schemas are locked
- `LockedSettingsView.swift` - Shown when settings are locked
- `SettingsView.swift` - Global app settings

## ‚úÖ **What's Already Implemented**

### **Core Functionality**
- ‚úÖ Complete schema creation flow (3-step process)
- ‚úÖ App selection using iOS Family Activity Picker
- ‚úÖ Schedule-based blocking conditions
- ‚úÖ Daily usage limit conditions
- ‚úÖ Schema activation/deactivation
- ‚úÖ Global strict mode system

- ‚úÖ Comprehensive debug overlay for development
- ‚úÖ Consistent locked view patterns
- ‚úÖ Real-time status indicators
- ‚úÖ Smooth tab navigation with conditional rendering

## üö® **Critical Issues That Need Fixing**

### **Priority 1: Real-Time Schedule Evaluation**
**Problem**: When a scheduled block ends, apps remain restricted instead of automatically becoming accessible.

**Root Cause**: No background service continuously evaluates schedule conditions.

**Impact**: Users stay blocked even when they should have access, requiring manual intervention.

### **Priority 2: Schema Synchronization**
**Problem**: UI shows active schemas but actual blocking may not be in sync.

**Root Cause**: Two separate tracking systems (UI state vs ScreenTime service) can get out of sync.

**Impact**: Debug shows "0 active schemas" while UI shows active schemas, and blocking may not work.

## üéØ **Finishing Touches Required**

### **1. Implement Real-Time Schedule Evaluation System**

#### **Create ScheduleEvaluationService**
```swift
// New file: phonejailOS/Services/ScheduleEvaluationService.swift
class ScheduleEvaluationService: ObservableObject {
    private var evaluationTimer: Timer?
    
    func startContinuousEvaluation() {
        // Check every minute if active schemas should still be active
        // Automatically deactivate schemas when schedule conditions end
        // Handle timezone changes and date transitions
    }
    
    func evaluateAllActiveSchemas() {
        // Check each active schema's conditions
        // Deactivate schemas whose conditions are no longer met
        // Update UI and ScreenTime blocking accordingly
    }
}
```

#### **Integration Points**
- Add to `ContentView.swift` as `@StateObject`
- Call `startContinuousEvaluation()` on app launch
- Integrate with `SchemaViewModel` for automatic deactivation
- Handle app backgrounding/foregrounding

#### **Success Criteria**
- Apps become accessible immediately when schedule ends
- No manual intervention required
- Works in background and foreground
- Handles timezone changes correctly

### **2. Enhanced Schema Management Features**

#### **Schema Editing**
- Create `EditSchemaView.swift` - Allow users to modify existing schemas
- Add edit button to schema rows in `SchemasView.swift`
- Implement validation for schema modifications

#### **Schema Operations**
- **Duplicate Schema**: Clone existing schemas with new names
- **Delete Schema**: Confirmation dialog with cascade deletion
- **Import/Export**: JSON-based schema sharing between devices
